# tic-tac-toe

Algorithms for playing tic-tac-tie. Inspired by Daniel Saubel [article](https://medium.com/swlh/tic-tac-toe-and-deep-neural-networks-ea600bc53f51) and [repository](https://github.com/djsauble/tic-tac-toe-ai) but using variety of approaches.

## Results

Results for algorithms including Saubel's neural network are presented in this table.

| Algorithm    | Wins when plays first | Draws when plays first | Loss when plays first | Wins when plays second | Draws when plays second | Loss when plays second |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Saubel       | 95.0%                 | 3.4%                   | 1.6%                  | 42.7%                  | 53.0%                   | 4.3%                   |
| Probalistic  | 97.8%                 | 2.16%                  | 0.0%                  | 62.85%                 | 21.92%                  | 15.23%                 |

Propabilistic algorithm is great at winning games but have problems forcing a draw while playing second. Saubel's network have lesser chances of winning which can be explained by using inconsistend training data leading to troubled convergence and quite high loss but still forces more draws while playing second.
