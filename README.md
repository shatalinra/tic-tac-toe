# tic-tac-toe

Neural network for playing tic-tac-tie. Initial approach is based on Daniel Saubel [article](https://medium.com/swlh/tic-tac-toe-and-deep-neural-networks-ea600bc53f51) and [repository](https://github.com/djsauble/tic-tac-toe-ai) but switched from Keras to PyTorch and tweaked architecture for self-education purposes.

## Goal

Higher winning chance than Daniel Saubel model.
